            <p> <strong>The World Wide Web (WWW)</strong>, commonly known as the Web, is an information system where
                documents
                and other web
                resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be
                interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the Web are
                transferred
                via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a
                web
                browser, and are published by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not
                synonymous
                with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon the technologies of
                which
                the Web is built.</p>
